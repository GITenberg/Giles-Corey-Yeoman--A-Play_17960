<h3 align="center">Act I.</h3>

<p>Scene I.&mdash;<i>Salem Village. Living-room in</i> Giles Corey's
<i>house.</i>  Olive Corey <i>is spinning.</i>  Nancy Fox, <i>the old
servant, sits in the fireplace paring apples. Little</i> Ph&oelig;be
Morse, <i>on a stool beside her, is knitting a stocking.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>starting</i>). What is that? Oh, Olive,
what is that?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Yes, what is that? Massy, what a clatter!</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>spinning</i>). I heard naught. Be not so foolish,
child. And you, Nancy, be of a surety old enough to know better.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I trow there was a clatter in the chimbly. There
'tis again! Massy, what a screech!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>running to</i> Olive <i>and clinging to
her</i>). Oh, Olive, what is it? what is it? Don't let it catch me.
Oh, Olive!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I tell you 'twas naught.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Them that won't hear be deafer than them that's
born so. Massy, what a screech!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Olive, Olive! Don't let 'em catch me!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nobody wants to catch you. Be quiet now, and I'll
sing to you. Then you won't think you hear screeches.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  We won't, hey?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Be quiet! This folly hath gone too far. [<i>Sings
spinning song.</i></p>

<p>SPINNING SONG.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I'll tell you a story; a story of one,
<br>'Twas of a great prince whose name was King John.
<br>A great prince was he, and a man of great might
<br>In putting down wrong and in setting up right.
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Massy, what screeches! [<i>Screams
violently.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, 'twas you screeched then.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  It wasn't me; 'twas a witch in the chimbly.
(<i>Screams again.</i>)  There, hear that, will ye? I tell ye
'twa'n't me. I 'ain't opened my mouth.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nancy, I will bear no more of this. If you be not
quiet, I will tell my mother when she comes home. Now, Ph&oelig;be,
sing the rest of the song with me, and think no more of such folly.
[<i>Sings with</i> Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;This king, being a mind to make himself merry,
<br>He sent for the Bishop of Canterbury.
<br>&lsquo;Good-morning, Mr. Bishop,&rsquo; the king did say.
<br>&lsquo;Have you come here for to live or to die?&rsquo;
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;&lsquo;For if you can't answer to my questions
three,
<br>Your head shall be taken from your body;
<br>And if you can't answer unto them all right,
<br>Your head shall be taken from your body quite.&rsquo;
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p><i>Nancy</i> (<i>wagging her head in time to the music</i>). I
know some words that go better with that tune.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  What are they?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Oh, I'm forbid to tell.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Who forbade you to tell, Nancy?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  The one who forbade me to tell, forbade me to tell
who told me.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Don't gossip, or you won't get your stints done
before mother comes home.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). I won't finish my stint. Aunt
Corey set me too long a stint. I won't. Oh, there she is now!
[<i>Knits busily.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Ann Hutchins.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>rising</i>). Well done, Ann. I was but now
wishing to see you. Sit you down and lay off your cloak. Why, how
pale you look, Ann! Are you sick?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  You know best.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I? Why, what mean you, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  You know what I mean, in spite of your innocent
looks. Oh, open your eyes wide at me, if you want to! Perhaps you
don't know what makes them bigger and bluer than they used to be.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Ann!</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Oh, I mean nothing. I am not sick. Something
frightened me as I came through the wood.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Frightened you! Why, what was it?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, what was it, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I know not; something black that hustled quickly by
me and raised a cold wind.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, oh!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  'Twas a cat or a dog, and your own fear raised the
cold wind. Think no more of it, Ann. Wait a moment while I go to the
north room. I have something to show you. [<i>Exit</i> Olive <i>with
a candle.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  What said the black thing to you, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I know not.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Said it not: &ldquo;Serve me; serve me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I know not. I was deaf with fear.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Ann, did it have horns?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I tell you I know not. You pester me, child.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Did it have hoofs and a tail?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Be quiet, I tell you, or I'll cuff your ears.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  She needn't be so topping. It will be laying in
wait for her when she goes home. I'll warrant it won't let her off so
easy.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Olive, <i>bringing an embroidered muslin cape. She
puts it gently over</i> Ann's <i>shoulders.</i></p>

<p><i>Ann</i> (<i>throwing it off violently</i>). Oh! oh! Take it
away! take it away!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Why, Ann, what ails you?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Take it away, I say! What mean you by your cursed
arts?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Why, Ann! I have been saving a long time to buy it
for you. 'Tis like my last summer's cape that you fancied so much. I
sent by father to Boston for it.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I need it not.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I thought 'twould suit well with your green
gown.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  'Twill suit well enough with a green gown, but not
with a sore heart.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I miss my guess but it 'll suit well enough with
her heart too. I trow that's as green as her gown; green's the
jealous color.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  You be all unstrung by your walk hither through the
wood, Ann. I'll fold the cape up nicely for you, and you can take it
when you go home. And mind you wear it next Sabbath day, sweet. Now I
must to my wheel again, or I shall not finish my stint by nine
o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Your looks show that you were up later than nine
o'clock last night.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Ann, did you see the light in the fore
room?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  That did I. I stood at my chamber and saw it shine
through the wood.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  You couldn't see so far without spectacles.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  It blinded me. I could get no sleep.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  You think your eyes are mighty sharp. Maybe your
ears are too? Maybe you heard 'em kissing at the door when he went
home?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nancy, be quiet!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  You needn't color up and shake your head at me,
Olive. They stood kissing there nigh an hour, and he with his arm
round her waist, and she with hers round his neck. They'd kiss, then
they'd eye each other and kiss again. I know I woke up and thought
'twas Injuns, and I peeked out of my chamber window. Such doings!
You'd ought to have seen 'em, Ann.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, why didn't you wake me up?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nancy, I'll have no more of this.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  That's what she ought to have said last
night&mdash;hadn't she, Ann? But she didn't. Oh, I'll warrant she
didn't! I know you would, Ann.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nancy! [<i>A noise is heard outside.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, what's that noise? What is coming?</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Giles Corey, <i>panting. He flings the door to
violently and slips the bolt.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Massy! what's after ye?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Uncle Corey, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  The matter is there be too many evil things abroad
nowadays for a man to be out after nightfall. When things that can be
hit by musket balls lay in wait, old Giles Corey is as brave as any
man; but when it comes to devilish black beasts and black men that
musket balls bound back from&mdash; What! you here, Ann Hutchins?
What be you out after dark for?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I came over to see Olive, Goodman Corey.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  You'd best stayed by your own hearth if you've got
one. Young women have no call to be out gadding after dark in these
times.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Uncle Corey, something did frighten Ann
as she came through the wood. A black beast, with horns and a tail
and eyes like balls of fire, jumped out of the bushes at her, and
bade her sign the book in a dreadful voice.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  What! Was't so, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I know not. There was something.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>laughing</i>). 'Twas naught but Ann's own shadow
that her fear gave a voice and a touch to. Say naught to frighten
Ann, father; she is the most timorous maid in Salem Village now.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  There is some wisdom in fear nowadays. You make too
light of it, lass.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Nay, father, I'll turn to and hang
up my own shadow in the chimbly-place for a witch, an you say so.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  This be no subject for jest. Said you the black
beast spoke to you, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I know not. Once I thought I heard Olive calling. I
know not what I heard.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  You'd best have stayed at home. Where is your
mother, Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  She has gone to Goodwife Bishop's with a basket of
eggs.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Gone three miles to Goodwife Bishop's this time of
night? Is the woman gone out of her senses?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  She is not afraid.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I'll warrant she is not afraid. So much the worse
for her. Mayhap she's gone riding on a broomstick herself. How is the
cat?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  She is better.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  She was taken strangely, if your mother did make
light of it. And the ox, hath he fell down again?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Not that I have heard.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  The ox was taken strangely, if your mother did pooh
at it. The ox was better when she went out of the yard.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  There's Aunt Corey now. Who is she talking
to?</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Martha Corey.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Who were you talking to, Aunt Corey?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Nobody, child. Good-evening, Ann.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  I heard you talking to somebody, Aunt
Corey.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Be quiet, child. I was talking to nobody. You hear
too much nowadays. [<i>Takes off her cloak.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Mayhap she hears more than folk want her to. I
heard a voice too, a gruff voice like a pig's.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I thought I heard talking too. Who was it,
Martha?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I tell you 'twas no one. Are you all out of your
wits? [<i>Gets some knitting-work out of a cupboard and seats
herself.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Weren't you afraid coming through the wood,
Aunt Corey?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Afraid? Why, no, child. Of what
should I be afraid?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I trow there's plenty to be afraid of. How did you
get home so quick? 'Tis a good three miles to Goody Bishop's.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I walked at a good speed.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I thought perhaps you galloped a broomstick.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Nay, goodman, I know not how to manage such a
strange steed.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I thought perhaps one had taught you, inasmuch as
you have naught to say against the gentry that ride the broomstick of
a night.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Fill not the child's head with such folly. How
fares your mother, Ann?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Well, Goodwife Corey.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  She lacks sense, or she would have kept her
daughter at home. Out after nightfall, and the woods full of the
devil knoweth what.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Nay, goodman, there be no danger. The scouts are
in the fields.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I meant not Injuns. There be worse than Injuns.
There be evil things and witches!</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Witches! Goodman, you are a worse
child than Ph&oelig;be here.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I tell ye, wife, you talk like a fool, ranting thus
against witches. I would you had been where I have been to-night, and
heard the afflicted maids cry out in torment, being set upon by Sarah
Good and Sarah Osborn. I would you had seen Mercy Lewis strangled
almost to death, and the others testifying 'twas Sarah Good thus
afflicting her. But I'll warrant you'd not have believed them.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>laughing</i>). That I would not, goodman. I
would have said that the maids should be sent home and soundly
trounced, then put to bed, with a quart bowl of sage tea apiece.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Talk so if you will. One of these days folk will
say you be a witch yourself. You were ever hard-skulled, and could
knock your head long against a truth without being pricked by it.
Hold out if you can, when only this morning the ox and the cat were
took so strangely here in our own household.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Shame on you, goodman! The ox and the cat
themselves would laugh at you. The cat ate a rat, and it did not set
well on her stomach, and the ox slipped in the mire in the yard.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  'Twas more than that. I know, I know.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Laugh if you will, wife. Mayhap you know more about
it than other folk. You never could abide the cat. I am going to bed,
if I can first go to prayer. Last night the words went from me
strangely! But you will laugh at that. [<i>Lights a candle.
Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Aunt Corey, may I eat an apple?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Not to-night. 'Twill give you the nightmare.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  No, 'twill not.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Be still!</p>

<p><i>There is a knock.</i>  Olive <i>opens the door. Enter</i> Paul
Bayley. Ann <i>starts up.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Good-evening, goodwife. Good-evening, Olive.
Good-evening, Ann. 'Tis a fine night out.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I must be going; 'tis late.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nay, Ann, 'tis not late. Wait, and Paul will go
home with you through the wood.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I must be going.</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). Then let me go with you,
Mistress Ann! I can well do my errand here later.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Nay, I can wait whilst you do the errand, if you are
speedy. I fear lest the delay would make you ill at ease.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>quickly</i>). There is no need, Paul. I will go
with Ann. I want to borrow a hood pattern of Goodwife Nourse on the
way.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  But will you not be afraid, goodwife?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Afraid, and the moon at a good half, and only a
short way to go?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  But you have to go through the wood.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  The wood! A stretch as long as this room&mdash;six
ash-trees, one butternut, and a birch sapling thrown in for a witch
spectre. Say no more, Paul. Sit you down and keep Olive company. I
will go, if only for the sake of showing these silly little hussies
that there is no call for a gospel woman with prayer in her heart to
be afraid of anything but the wrath of God. [<i>Puts a blanket over
her head.</i></p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I want no company at all, Goodwife Corey.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Aunt Corey, let me go, too; my stint is
done.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Nay, you must to bed, and Nancy too. Off with ye,
and no words.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I'm none so old that I must needs be sent to bed
like a babe, I'd have you know that, Goody Corey. [<i>Sets away apple
pan; exit, with</i> Ph&oelig;be <i>following sulkily.</i></p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Come, Ann.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I want no company. I have more fear with company than
I have alone.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Along with you, child.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, Ann, you are forgetting your cape. Here,
mother, you carry it for her. Good-night, sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I want no company, Goodwife Corey. [Martha <i>takes
her laughingly by the arm and leads her out.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  It is a fine night out.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  So I have heard.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  You make a jest of me, Mistress Olive. Know you not
when a man is of a sudden left alone with a fair maid, he needs to
try his speech like a player his fiddle, to see if it be in good tune
for her ears; and what better way than to sound over and over again
the praise of the fine weather? What ailed Ann that she seemed so
strangely, Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I know not. I think she had been overwrought by
coming alone through the woods.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  She seemed ill at ease. Why spin you so steadily,
Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I must finish my stint.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Who set you a stint as if you were a child?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Mine own conscience, to which I will ever be a
child.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Cease spinning, sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nay.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Come over here on the settle, there is something I
would tell thee.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Tell it, then. I can hear a distance of three feet
or so.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I know thou canst, but come.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nay, I will not. This is no courting night. I
cannot idle every night in the week.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Thou wouldst make a new commandment. A maid shall
spin flax every night in the week save the Sabbath, when she shall
lay aside her work and be courted. There be young men here in Salem
Village, though you may credit it not, Olive, who visit their maids
twice every week, and have the fire in the fore room kindled.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My mother thinks it not well that I should sit up
oftener than once a week, nor do I; but be not vexed by it, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I love thee better for it, sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My stint is done.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Then come. (<i>She obeys.</i>)  Now for the news.
This morning I bought of Goodman Nourse his nine-acre lot for a
homestead. What thinkest thou of that?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  It is a pleasant spot.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  'Tis not far from here, and thou wilt be near thy
mother.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Was it not too costly?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I had saved enough to pay for it, and in another
year's time, and I have the help of God in it, I shall have saved
enough for our house. What thinkest thou of a gambrel-roof and a
lean-to, two square front rooms, both fire-rooms, and a living-room?
And peonies and hollyhocks in the front yard, and two popple-trees,
one on each side of the gate?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  We shall need not a lean-to, Paul, and one
fire-room will serve us well; but I will have laylocks and red and
white roses as well as peonies and hollyhocks in the front yard, and
some mint under the windows to make the house smell sweet; and I like
well the popple-trees at the gate.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  The house shall be built of fairly seasoned yellow
pine wood, with a summer tree in every room, and fine panel-work in
the doors and around the chimbleys.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Nay, Paul, not too fine panel-work; 'twill cost too
high.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Cupboards in every room, and fine-laid white
floors.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  We need a cupboard in the living-room only, but I
have learned to sand a floor in a rare pattern. [Paul <i>attempts to
embrace</i> Olive. <i>She repulses him.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I trow you are full provident of favors and pence,
Olive.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I would save them for thee, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  And thou shalt not be hindered by me to any harm,
sweetheart. Was't thy mother taught thee such wisdom, or thine own
self, Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  'Twas my mother.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Nay, 'twas thine own heart; that shall teach me,
too. [<i>Nine-o'clock bell rings.</i></p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, 'tis nine o'clock, and 'tis not a courting
night. Paul, be off; thou must! [<i>They jump up and go to the
door.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>putting his arm around</i> Olive). Give me but one
kiss, Olive, albeit not a courting night, for good speed on my
homeward walk and my to-morrow's journey.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Where go you to-morrow, Paul?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  To Boston, for a week's time or more.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, Paul, there may be Injuns on the Boston path!
Thou wilt be wary?</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Have no fear for me, sweetheart. I
shall have my musket.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  A week?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  'Tis a short time, but long enough to need
sweetening with a kiss when folk are absent from one another.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>kisses him</i>). Oh, be careful, Paul!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Fear not for me, sweetheart, but do thou too be
careful, for sometimes danger sneaks at home, when we flee it abroad.
Keep away from this witchcraft folly. Good-by, sweetheart. [<i>They
part.</i>  Olive <i>sets a candle in the window after</i> Paul's
<i>exit. Nine-o'clock bell still rings as curtain falls.</i></p>

<p><br>Scene II.&mdash;<i>Twelve o'clock at night. Living-room at</i>
Giles Corey's <i>house, lighted only by the moon and low fire-light.
Enter</i> Nancy Fox <i>with a candle,</i> Ph&oelig;be <i>following
with a large rag doll.</i>  Nancy <i>sets the candle on the
dresser.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Be ye sure that Goody Corey is asleep, and Goodman
Corey?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>dances across to the door, which she opens
slightly, and listens</i>). They be both a-snoring. Hasten and begin,
I pray you, Nancy.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  And Olive?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  She is asleep, and she is in the south
chamber, and could not hear were she awake. Here is my doll. Now show
me how to be a witch. Quick, Nancy!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Whom do you desire to afflict?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>considers</i>). Let me see. I will afflict
Uncle Corey, because he brought me naught from Boston to-day; Olive,
because she gave that cape to Ann instead of me; and Aunt Corey,
because she set me such a long stint, because she would not let me
eat an apple to-night, and because she sent me to bed. I want to
stick one pin into Uncle Corey, one into Olive, and three into Aunt
Corey.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Take the doll, prick it as you will, and say who
the pricks be for. [Ph&oelig;be <i>sticks a pin into the
doll.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  This pin be for Uncle Corey, and this pin be
for Olive, and this pin for Aunt Corey, and this pin for Aunt Corey,
and this pin for Aunt Corey. Pins! pins!! pins!!! (<i>Dances.</i>)
In truth, Nancy, 'tis rare sport being a witch; but I stuck not in
the pins very far, lest they be too sorely hurt.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Is there any other whom you desire to afflict?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  I fear I know not any other who has angered
me, and I could weep for 't. Stay! I'll afflict Ann, because she hath
the cape; and I'll afflict Paul Bayley, because I'm drove forth from
the fore room Sabbath nights when he comes a-courting; and I'll
afflict Minister Parris, because he put me too hard a question from
the catechism; that makes three more. Oh, 'tis rare sport! (<i>Seizes
the doll and sticks in three pins.</i>)  This pin be for Ann, this
pin be for Paul, and this pin be for Minister Parris. Deary me, I can
think of no more! What next, Nancy?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I'll do some witchcraft now. I desire to afflict
your aunt Corey, because she doth drive me hither and thither like a
child, and sets no value on my understanding; Olive, because she made
a jest of me; and Goody Bishop, because she hath a fine silk
hood.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Here is the doll, Nancy.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Nay, I have another way, which you be too young to
understand. [Nancy <i>takes the candle, goes to the fireplace, and
courtesies three times, looking up the chimney.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Hey, black cat! hey, my pretty black cat! Go ye and
sit on Goody Corey's breast, and claw her if she stirs. Do as I bid
ye, my pretty black cat, and I'll sign the book.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, I hear the black cat yawl!</p>

<p><i>Nancy</i> (<i>after courtesying three times</i>). Hey, black
dog! hey, my pretty black dog! Go ye and howl in Mistress Olive's
ear, so she be frighted in her dreams, and so get a little bitter
with the sweet. Do as I bid ye, my pretty black dog, and I'll sign
the book.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, I hear the black dog howl!</p>

<p><i>Nancy</i> (<i>after courtesying three times</i>). Hey, yellow
bird! hey, my pretty yellow bird! Go ye and peck at Goody Bishop's
fine silk hood and tear it to bits. Do as I bid ye, my pretty yellow
bird, and I'll sign the book.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, I hear the yellow bird twitter up
chimbly!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  'Tis rare witchcraft.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Is that all, Nancy?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  All of this sort. I've given them all they can do
to-night.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Then sing the witch song, Nancy.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I'll sing the witch song, and you can dance on the
table.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  But 'tis sinful to dance, Nancy!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  'Tis not sinful for a witch.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  True; I forgot I was a witch. [<i>Gets upon
the table and dances, dangling her doll, while</i> Nancy
<i>sings.</i></p>

<p>WITCH SONG.
<br>(Same air as Spinning Song.)</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;I'll tell you a story, a story of one;
<br>'Twas of a dark witch, and the wizard her son.
<br>A dark witch was she, and a dark wizard he,
<br>With yellow birds singing so gay and so free.
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;The clock was a-striking, a-striking of one.
<br>The witches came out, and the dancing begun.
<br>They courtesied so fine, and they drank the red wine&mdash;
<br>The wizards were three and the witches were nine.
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Halloo, the gay dancers! Halloo, I was one;
<br>The goody that prayed and the maiden that spun!
<br>The yellow birds chirped in the boughs overhead,
<br>And fast through the bushes the black dog sped.
<br>To my down, down, down, derry down.&rdquo;
<br>[<i>A noise is heard.</i>  Ph&oelig;be <i>jumps down from the
table.</i></blockquote>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, something's coming! Run, run
quick, or it 'll catch us! [<i>Both run out. Curtain falls.</i></p>

<h3 align="center">Act II.</h3>

<p><i>Best room in the house of</i> Widow Eunice Hutchins, Ann's
<i>mother.</i>  John Hathorne <i>and</i> Minister Parris <i>enter,
shown in by</i> Widow Hutchins.</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  I pray you, sirs, to take some cheers the while
I go for a moment's space to my poor afflicted child. I heard her cry
out but now. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p>[Hathorne <i>and</i> Parris <i>seat themselves, but</i> Hathorne
<i>quickly springs up, and begins walking.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  I cannot be seated in this crisis. I would as
lief be seated in an onset of the savages. I must up and lay about
me. We have heretofore been too lax in this dreadful business; the
powers of darkness be almost over our palisades. I tell thee there
must be more action!</p>

<p><i>Parris</i> (<i>pounding with his cane</i>). Yea, Master
Hathorne, I am with thee. Verily, this last be enough to make the
elect themselves quake with fear. This Martha Corey is a woman of the
covenant.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  There must be no holding back. The powers of
darkness be let loose amongst us, and they that be against them must
be up. We must hang, hang, hang, till we overcome!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Yea, we must not falter, though all the woods of
Massachusetts Bay be cut for gallows-trees, and the country be like
Sodom. Verily, Satan hath manifested himself at the head of our
enemies; the colonies were never in such peril as now. We must strive
as never before, or all will be lost. The wilderness full of
malignant savages, who be the veritable servants of Satan, closes us
in, and the cloven footmark is in our midst. There must be no
dallying as we would save the colonies. Widow Hutchins saith her
daughter is grievously pressed. (<i>A scream.</i>)  There, heard you
that?</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  It is dreadful, dreadful, that an innocent maid
should be so tormented by acts which her guileless fancy could never
compass!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Verily, malignity hath ever cowardice in
conjunction with it. Satan loveth best to afflict those who can make
no defence, and fastens his talons first in the lambs.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Widow Hutchins <i>with the embroidered cape.</i></p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Here, your worships, is the cape.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne</i> (<i>examines it</i>). I have seen women folk wear
its like on the Sabbath day. I can see naught unwonted about it.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  It looketh like any cape.</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  I fear it be not like any cape. Had your
worships seen my poor child writhe under it, and I myself, when I
would try it on, bent down to my knees as under a ton weight, your
worships would not think it like any cape.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  I suspect there be verily evil work in the cape,
and a witch's bodkin hath pierced these cunning eyelets. It goeth so
fast now that erelong every guileless, senseless thing in our houses,
down to the tinder-box and the candle-stick, will find hinges and
turn into a gate, whereby witchcraft can enter. You say, Widow
Hutchins, that Olive Corey gave this cape to your daughter?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  That did she. Yesterday evening Ann went down to
Goody Corey's house for a little chat; she and Olive have been
gossips ever since they were children, though lately there hath been
somewhat of bitterness betwixt them.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  How mean you?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  I have laid it upon my mind ere now to tell you,
being much wrought up concerning it, and thinking that you might give
me somewhat of spiritual consolation and advice. It was in this wise.
Paul Bayley, who, they say, goeth every Sabbath night to Goody
Corey's house and sitteth up until unseemly hours with Olive, looked
once with a favorable eye upon my daughter Ann. Had your worships
seen him, as I saw him one day in the meeting-house, look at Ann when
she wore her green paduasoy, you had not doubted. Youths look not
thus upon maidens unless they be inclined toward them. But this hussy
Olive Corey did come between Paul and my Ann, and that not of her own
merits. There is nobody in Salem Village who would say that Olive
Corey's looks be aught in comparison with my Ann's, but I trow Goody
Corey hath arts which make amends for lack of beauty. I trow all
ill-favored folk might be fair would they have such arts used upon
them.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What mean you by that saying?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  I mean Goody Corey hath devilish arts whereby
she giveth her daughter a beauty beyond her own looks, wherewith she
may entice young men.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  You say that this cape caused your daughter
torment?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Your worships, it lay on her neck like a
fire-brand, and she thought she should die ere she cast it off.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Widow Hutchins, will you now put on the
cape?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Oh, your worship, I dare not put it on! I fear
it will be the death of me if I do.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Minister Parris, wilt thou put on the cape?</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Good Master Hathorne, it would ill behoove a
minister of the gospel to put himself in jeopardy when so many be
depending upon him to lead them in this dreadful conflict with the
powers of darkness. But do thou put on the mantle the while I go to
prayer to avert any ill that may come of it.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Nay, I will make no such jest of my office of
magistrate as to put this woman's gear on my shoulders. I doubt if
there be aught in it. Prithee, Widow Hutchins, when did this torment
first come upon the young woman?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Your worship, she went, as I have said, to Goody
Corey's yester-evening to have a little chat with her gossip, Olive,
and Paul Bayley came in also, and some of them did talk strangely
about this witchcraft, Olive and Goody Corey nodding and winking, and
making light of it. And then when Ann said she must be home, Paul
rose quickly and made as though he would go with her, but Goody Corey
would not let him, and herself went with Ann. And she did practise
her devilish arts upon my poor child all the way home, and when my
poor child got on the door-stone she burst open the door, and came in
as though all the witches were after her, and she hath not been
herself since. She hath ever since been grievously tormented, being
set upon now by Goody Corey, and now by Olive, being choked and
twisted about until I thought she would die, and so I fear she will,
unless they be speedily put in chains. It seemeth flesh and blood
cannot endure it. Mercy Lewis is just come in, and she saw Goody
Corey and Olive upon her when she opened the door.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  This evil work must be stopped at all hazards,
and this monstrous brood of witches gotten out of the land.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Yea, verily, although we have to reach under the
covenant for them. [<i>Screams.</i></p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Oh, your worships, my poor child will have no
peace until they be chained in prison.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  They shall be chained in prison before the sun
sets. I will at once go forth and issue warrants for the arrest of
Martha Corey and her daughter. [<i>More violent screams and loud
voices overhead.</i></p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Would it not be well, good Master Hathorne, for us
to see the afflicted maid before we depart?</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Oh, I pray you, sirs, come up stairs to my poor
child's chamber and see yourselves in what grievous torment she lies.
She hath often called for Minister Parris, saying they dared not so
afflict her were he there.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  It would perchance be as well. Lead the way, if
you will, Widow Hutchins. [<i>Exeunt. Screams continue.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Nancy Fox <i>and</i> Ph&oelig;be Morse <i>stealthily
from other door.</i>  Ph&oelig;be <i>carries her rag doll.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Massy sakes, hear them screeches!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>clinging to</i> Nancy). Oh, Nancy, won't
they catch us too! I'm afraid!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  They can't touch us; we're witches too.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Massy sakes! I forgot we were witches.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Hear that, will ye? Ain't she a-ketchin' it?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Nancy, do you suppose it's the pin I stuck in
my doll makes Ann screech that way?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Most likely 'tis. Stick in another, and see if she
screeches louder.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  No, I won't. I'll pull the pin out; 'twas
this one in my doll's arm. (<i>Pulls out pin and flings it on the
floor.</i>)  I won't have Ann hurt so bad as that if Olive did give
her the cape. Why don't she stop screeching now, Nancy? Oh, Nancy,
somebody's coming! I hear somebody at the door. Crawl under the
bed&mdash;quick! quick!</p>

<p>[Ph&oelig;be <i>gets down and begins to crawl under the bed.</i>
Nancy <i>tries to imitate her, but cannot bend herself.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Oh, massy! I've got a crick in my back, and I can't
double up. What shall I do? (<i>Tries to bend.</i>)  I can't; no, I
can't! 'Tis like a hot poker. Massy! what 'll I do?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  You've got to, Nancy. Quick! the latch is
lifting. Quick! quick! I'll push you. No; I'll pull you. Here!</p>

<p>[<i>Pulls</i> Nancy <i>down upon the floor, and rolls her under
the bed; gets under herself just as the door is pushed open.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Giles Corey <i>in great excitement.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles</i> (<i>running across the room, and listening at the
door leading to the chamber stairs</i>). Devil take them! why don't
they put an end to it? Why do they let the poor lass be set upon this
way? Screeching so you can hear her all over Salem Village! There!
hear that, will ye? Out upon them! Widow Hutchins! Widow Hutchins!
Can't you give her some physic? Sha'n't I come up there with my
musket? Why don't they find out who is so tormenting her and chain
her up in prison? 'Tis some witch or other. Oh, I'd hang her; I'd tie
the rope myself. Poor lass! poor lass! [<i>The door is pushed open,
and</i> Giles <i>starts back.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter</i> John Hathorne, Minister Parris, <i>and</i> Widow
Hutchins.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Good-day, Widow Hutchins. Shall I go up there with
my musket?</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  I trow there be too many of thy household up there
now.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I'd lay about me till I hit some of 'em. I'll
warrant I would. Oh, the poor lass! hear that!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  She is a grievous case.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I heard the screeches out in the wood, and I ran in
thinking I might do somewhat. I would Martha were here. I'll be bound
she'd laugh and scoff at it no longer!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Laugh and scoff, say you?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  That she doth. Martha acts as if the devil were in
her about it. She doth nothing but laugh at and make light of the
afflicted children, and saith there be no witches. She would not even
believe 'twas aught out of the common when our ox and cat were took
strangely. If she were herself a witch she could be no more
stiff-necked.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Doth she go out after nightfall?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  That she doth, in spite of all I can say. She hath
no fear that an honest gospel woman should have in these times. She
went out last night, and I was so angered that I charged her with
galloping a broomstick home.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Did she deny it?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  She laughed as she is wont to do. She even made a
jest on't, when I could not when I would go to prayer, and the words
stayed beyond my wits. I would she could be here now, and hear
this!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Perchance she doth.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I'll warrant she'd lose somewhat of her
stiff-neckedness. Hear that! Can't ye chain up the witch that's
tormenting the poor lass! Is't Goody Osborn?</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  The witch will be chained and in prison before
nightfall. Come, Minister Parris, we can do no good by abiding longer
here. Methinks we have sufficient testimony.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Verily the devil hath played into our hands.
[<i>They turn to leave.</i></p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Oh, your worships, ye will use good speed for
the sake of my poor child.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Ay, be speedy about it. Put the baggage in prison
as soon as may be, and load her down well with irons.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  I will strive to obey your commands well,
Goodman Corey. Good-day, Widow Hutchins; your daughter shall soon
find relief.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Good-day, Widow Hutchins, and be of good
cheer.</p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> Hathorne <i>and</i> Parris, <i>while</i> Widow
Hutchins <i>courtesies.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Well, I must even be going too. I have my cattle to
water. I but bolted in when I heard the poor lass screech, thinking I
might do somewhat. But good Master Hathorne will see to it. Hear
that! Do ye go up to her, widow, and mix her up a bowl of yarb tea,
till they put the trollop in prison. I'm off to water my cattle, then
devil take me if I don't give the sheriffs a hand if they need it.
Goody Osborn's house is nigh mine. Good-day, widow. [<i>Exit</i>
Giles.</p>

<p><i>Hutchins</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Give the sheriffs a hand, will
he? Perchance he will, but I doubt me if 'tis not a fisted one. He
sets his life by Goody Corey, however he rate her. (<i>A scream from
above of</i> &ldquo;Mother! Mother!&rdquo;)  Yes, Ann, I'm coming,
I'm coming! [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>crawls out from under the bed</i>). Now,
Nancy, we've got a chance to run. Come out, quick! Oh, if Uncle Corey
had caught us here!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I can't get out. Oh! oh! The rheumatiz stiffened me
so I couldn't double up, and now it has stiffened me so I can't
undouble. No, 'tis not rheumatiz, 'tis Goody Bishop has bewitched me.
I can't get out.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  You must, Nancy, or some body 'll come and
catch us. Here, I'll pull you out.</p>

<p>[<i>Tugs at</i> Nancy's <i>arms, and drags her out,
groaning.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Here I am out, but I can't undouble. I'll have to
go home on all-fours like a cat. Oh! oh!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Give me your hands and I'll pull you up.
Think you 'tis witchcraft, Nancy?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I know 'tis. 'Tis Goody Bishop in her fine silk
hood afflicts me. Oh, massy!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  There, you are up, Nancy.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I ain't half undoubled.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  You can walk so, can't you, Nancy? Oh, come,
quick! I think I hear somebody on the stairs. (<i>Catches up her doll
and seizes</i> Nancy's <i>hand.</i>)  Quick! quick!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I tell ye I can't go quick; I ain't undoubled
enough. Devil take Goody Bishop!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  We have not sent for you to go to prayer, but to
confess that you are a witch.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I am no witch. I am a gospel woman. There is no
such thing as a witch. Shall I confess that I am what doth not exist?
It were not only a lie, but a fool's lie.</p>

is a great outcry from the</i> Afflicted Girls.</p>

<p><i>Afflicted Girls.</i>  She pinches us! Hold her hands! Hold her
hands again! Oh! oh!</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  She is upon me again! She digs her fingers into my
throat! Hold her hands! Hold her hands! She will be the death of
me!</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Devil take ye, ye lying trollop! 'Tis a pity
somebody had not been the death of ye before this happened!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Constables, hold the hands of the accused.</p>

<p>[Constables <i>obey, and at once the afflicted are quiet.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Goodwife Corey, what do you say to this?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I see with whom we have to do. May the Lord have
mercy upon us!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to the charges that your husband,
Giles Corey, hath many a time brought against you in the presence of
witnesses&mdash;that you hindered him when he would go to prayer,
causing the words to go from him strangely; that you were out after
nightfall, and did ride home on a broomstick; and that you scoffed at
these maids and their affliction, as if you were a witch
yourself?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I said not so! Martha, I said it not so!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to your husband's charge that you
did afflict his ox and cat, causing his ox to fall in the yard, and
the cat to be strangely sick?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Devil take the ox and the cat! I said not that she
did afflict them.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Peace, Goodman Corey; you are now in court.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I say, if a gospel woman is to be hung as a witch
for every stumbling ox and sick cat, 'tis setting a high value upon
oxen and cats.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I would mine had all been knocked in the head,
lass, and me too!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Peace! Ann Hutchins, what saw you when Goodwife
Corey went home with you through the wood?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Hold fast her hands, I pray, or she will kill me. The
trees were so full of yellow birds that it sounded as if a mighty
wind passed over them, and the birds lit on Goody Corey's head. And
black beasts ran alongside through the bushes, which did break and
crackle, and they were at Goody Corey and me to go to the witch dance
on the hill. And they said to bring Olive Corey and Paul Bayley. And
Goody Corey told them how she and Olive would presently come, but not
Paul, for he never would sign the book, not even though Olive trapped
him by the arts they had taught her. And Goody Corey showed me the
book then, and besought me to sign, and go with her to the dance. And
when I would not, she and Olive also afflicted me so grievously that
I thought I could not live, and have done so ever since.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to this, Goodwife Corey?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I pray your worship believe not what she doth
charge against my daughter.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Mercy Lewis, do you say that you have seen both of
the accused afflicting Ann Hutchins?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Yes, your worship, many a time have I seen them
pressing her to sign the book, and afflicting when she would not.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  How looked the book?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  'Twas black, your worship, with blood-red
clasps.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Read you the names in it?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  I strove to, your worship, but I got not through
the C's; there were too many of them.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Let the serving-woman, Nancy Fox, come
hither.</p>

<p>[Nancy Fox <i>makes her way to the front.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Nancy, I have heard that your mistress afflicts
you.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  That she doth.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  In what manner?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  She sendeth me to bed at first candlelight as
though I were a babe; she maketh me to wear a woollen petticoat in
winter-time, though I was not brought up to't; and she will never let
me drink more than one mug of cider at a sitting, and I nigh eighty,
and needing on't to warm my bones.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Hath she ever afflicted you? Your replies be not
to the point, woman.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Your worship, she hath never had any respect for my
understanding, and that hath greatly afflicted me.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Hath she ever shown you a book to sign?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Verily she hath; and when I would not, hath
afflicted me with sore pains in all my bones, so I cried out, on
getting up, when I had set awhile.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Hath your mistress a familiar?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Hey?</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Have you ever seen any strange thing with
her?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  She hath a yellow bird which sits on her cap when
she churns.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What else have you seen with her?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  A thing like a cat, only it went on two legs. It
clawed up the chimbly, and the soot fell down, and Goody Corey set me
to sweeping on't up on the Lord's day.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Out upon ye, ye lying old jade!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Silence! Nancy, you may go to your place.
Ph&oelig;be Morse, come hither.</p>

<p>[Ph&oelig;be Morse <i>approaches with her apron over her face,
sobbing. She has her doll under her arm.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Cease weeping, child. Tell me how your aunt
Corey treats you. Hath she ever taught you otherwise than you have
learned in your catechism?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>weeping</i>). I don't know. Oh, Aunt Corey,
I didn't mean to! I took the pins out of my doll, I did. Don't whip
me for it.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What doll? What mean you, child?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  I don't know. I didn't stick them in so very
deep, Aunt Corey! Don't let them hang me for it!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Did your aunt Corey teach you to stick pins into
your doll to torment folk?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>sobbing convulsively</i>). I don't know! I
don't know! Oh, Aunt Corey, don't let them hang me! Olive, you won't
let them! Oh! oh!</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Methinks 'twere as well to make an end of
this.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  There seemeth to me important substance under
this froth of tears. (<i>To</i> Ph&oelig;be.)  Give me thy doll,
child.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>clutching the doll</i>). Oh, my doll! my
doll! Oh, Aunt Corey, don't let them have my doll!</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Peace, dear child! Thou must not begrudge it.
Their worships be in sore distress just now to play with dolls.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Give his worship the doll, child. Hast thou not
been taught to respect them in authority?</p>

<p>[Ph&oelig;be <i>gives the doll to</i> Hathorne, <i>whimpering.</i>
 Hathorne, Corwin, <i>and</i> Parris <i>put their heads together over
it.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne</i> (<i>holding up the doll</i>). There be verily many
pins in this image. Goodwife Corey, what know you of this?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Your worship, such a weighty matter is beyond my
poor knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Know you whence the child got this image?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Yes, your worship. I myself made it out of a piece
of an old homespun blanket for the child to play with. I stuffed it
with lamb's wool, and sewed some green ravellings on its head for
hair. I made it a coat out of my copperas-colored petticoat, and
colored its lips and cheeks with pokeberries.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Did you teach the child to stick in these pins
wherewith to torment folk?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  It availeth me naught to say no, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Mercy</i> (<i>screams</i>). Oh, a sharp pain shoot through me
when I look at the image! 'Tis through my arms! Oh!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne</i> (<i>examining the doll</i>). There is a pin in the
arms.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  I feel sharp pains, like pins, in my face; oh, 'tis
dreadful!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne</i> (<i>examining the doll</i>). There are pins in the
face.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>sobbing</i>). No, no! Those are the pins I
stuck in for Aunt Corey. Don't let them hang me, Aunt Corey.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  That is sufficient. She has confessed.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Yes, methinks the child hath confessed whether
she would or no. Goodwife Corey, Ph&oelig;be hath now plainly said
that she did stick these pins in this image for you. What have you to
say?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>courtesying</i>). Your worship, the matter is
beyond my poor speech.</p>

<p>[Hathorne <i>tosses the doll on the table,</i> Ph&oelig;be
<i>watching anxiously.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Go to your place, child.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  I want my doll.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Go to thy place as his worship bids thee, and
think on the precepts in thy catechism. [Ph&oelig;be <i>returns
sobbing.</i></p>

<p><i>Afflicted Girls.</i>  Oh, Goody Corey turns her eyes upon us!
Bid her turn her eyes away!</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Oh, I see a black cat sitting on Goody Corey's
shoulder, and his eyes are like coals. Now, now, he looks at me when
Goody Corey does! Look away! look away! Oh, I am blind! I am blind!
Sparks are coming into my eyes from Goody Corey's. Make her turn her
eyes away, your worships; make her turn her eyes away!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Goody Corey, fix your eyes upon the floor, and
look not at these poor children whom you so afflict.</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  May the Lord open the eyes of the magistrates and
ministers, and give them sight to discover the guilty!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Why do you not confess that you are a witch?</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>with sudden fervor</i>). I am no witch. There is
no such thing as a witch. Oh, ye worshipful magistrates, ye ministers
and good people of Salem Village, I pray ye hear me speak for a
moment's space. Listen not to this testimony of distracted children,
this raving of a poor lovesick, jealous maid, who should be treated
softly, but not let to do this mischief. Ye, being in your fair wits
and well acquaint with your own knowledge, must know, as I know, that
there be no witches. Wherefore would God let Satan after such wise
into a company of His elect? Hath He not guard over His own precinct?
Can He not keep it from the power of the Adversary as well as we from
the savages? Why keep ye the scouts out in the fields if the Lord God
hath so forsaken us? Call in the scouts! If we believe in witches, we
believe not only great wickedness, but great folly of the Lord God.
Think ye in good faith that I verily stand here with a black cat on
my shoulder and a yellow bird on my head? Why do ye not see them as
well as these maids? I would that ye might if they be there. Black
cat, yellow bird, if ye be upon my shoulder and my head, as these
maids say, I command ye to appear to these magistrates! Otherwise, if
I have signed the book, as these maids say, I swear unto ye that I
will cross out my name, and will serve none but the God Almighty.
Most worshipful magistrates, see ye the black cat? See ye any yellow
bird? Why are ye not afflicted as well as these maids, when I turn my
eyes upon ye? I pray you to consider that. I am no saint; I wot well
that I have but poorly done the will of the Lord who made me, but I
am a gospel woman and keep to the faith according to my poor measure.
Can I be a gospel woman and a witch too? I have never that I know of
done aught of harm whether to man or beast. I have spared not myself
nor minded mine own infirmities in tasks for them that belonged to
me, nor for any neighbor that had need. I say not this to set myself
up, but to prove to you that I can be no witch, and my daughter can
be no witch. Have I not watched nights without number with the sick?
Have I not washed and dressed new-born babes? Have I not helped to
make the dead ready for burial, and sat by them until the cock crew?
Have I ever held back when there was need of me? But I say not this
to set myself up. Have I not been in the meeting-house every Lord's
day? Have I ever stayed away from the sacrament? Have I not gone in
sober apparel, nor wasted my husband's substance? Have I not been
diligent in my household, and spun and wove great store of linen? Are
not my floors scoured, my brasses bright, and my cheese-room well
filled? Look at me! Can I be a witch?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  A black man hath been whispering in her ear, telling
her what to say.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to that, Goody?</p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  I say if that be so, he told me not to his own
advantage. I see with whom I have to do. I pray you give me leave to
go to prayer.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  You are not here to go to prayer. I much fear
that your many prayers have been to your master, the devil.
Constables, bring forward the body of the accused.</p>

<p>[Afflicted Girls <i>shriek.</i>  Constables <i>lead</i> Olive
<i>forward.</i>  Martha <i>is led to one side.</i></p>

<p><i>Martha.</i>  Be of good cheer, dear child.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Yes, be not afraid of them, lass; thy father is
here.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Silence! Olive Corey, why do you so afflict
these other maids?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I do not, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  She is looking at me. Oh, bid her look away, or she
will kill me!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, Ann, I do not! What mean you, dear Ann?</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  I charge you, Olive Corey, keep your eyes upon
the floor.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Look where you please, lass, and thy old father
will uphold thee in it; and I only wish your blue eyes could shoot
pins into the lying hussies.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Goodman, an ye disturb the peace again, ye shall
be removed from court. Ann Hutchins, you have seen this maid hurt
you?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Many a time she hath hurt me nigh to death.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, Ann, I hurt thee?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  There is a flock of yellow birds around her head.</p>

<p>[Olive <i>moves her head involuntarily, and looks up.</i></p>

<p><i>Afflicted Girls.</i>  See her look at them!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to that, Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I did not see them.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Ann Hutchins, did you see this maid walking in
the wood with a black man last week?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  How did he go?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  In black clothes, and he had white hair.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  How went the accused?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  She went in her flowered petticoat, and the flowers
stood out, and smelt like real ones; her kerchief shone like a cobweb
in the grass in the morning, and gold sparks flew out of her hair.
Goody Corey fixed her up so with her devilish arts to trap Paul
Bayley.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What mean you?</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  To trap the black man, your worship. I knew not what
I said, I was in such torment.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Olive Corey, did your mother ever so change your
appearance by her arts?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My mother hath no arts, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Her cheeks were redder than was common, and her eyes
shone like stars.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Olive, did your mother so change your looks?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  No, your worship; I do not know what Ann may mean.
I fear she be ill.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Mercy Lewis, did you see Olive Corey with the
black man?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Yes, your worship; and she called out to me to go
with them to the dance, and I should have the black man for a
partner; and when I would not she afflicted me, pulling my hair and
pinching me.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  How appeared she to you?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  She was dressed like a puppet, finer than I had
ever seen her.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Olive, what did you wear when you walked with
the black man?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Your worship, I walked with no black man.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  There he is now, standing behind her, looking over
her shoulder.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What say you to that, Olive?</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>looking in terror over her shoulder</i>). I see
no one. I pray you, let my father stand near me.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Nay; the black man is enough for you.</p>

<p><i>Giles</i> (<i>forcing his way to his daughter</i>). Here I be,
lass; and it will go hard if the hussies can see the black man and
old Giles in one place. Where be the black man now, jades?</p>

<p><i>Hathorne</i> (<i>angrily</i>). Marshal!</p>

<p><i>Corwin</i> (<i>interposing</i>). Nay, good Master Hathorne, let
Goodman Corey keep his standing. The maid looks near swooning, and
albeit his manner be rude, yet his argument hath somewhat of force.
In truth, he and the black man cannot occupy one place. Mercy Lewis,
see you now this black man anywhere?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Yes, your worship.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Where?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Whispering in your worship's ear.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  May the Lord protect his magistrates from the
wiles of Satan, and maintain them in safety for the weal of his
afflicted people!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  This be going too far. This be presumption! Who
of you now see the black man whispering to the worshipful esquire
Jonathan Corwin?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  He is gone now out of the meeting-house. 'Twas but
for a moment I saw him.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Speak up, children. Did any other of ye see the
black man whispering to me?</p>

<p><i>Afflicted Girls.</i>  No! no! no!</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Mercy Lewis, you say of a truth you saw him?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Your worship, it may have been Minister Parris's
shadow falling across the platform.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  This is but levity, and hath naught to do with the
trial.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  We will proceed with the examination. Widow
Eunice Hutchins, produce the cape.</p>

<p>[Widow Hutchins <i>comes forward, holding the cape by a
corner.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Put it over your daughter's shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Hutchins.</i>  Oh, your worships, I pray you not! It will kill
her!</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Oh, do not! do not! It will kill me! Oh, mother, do
not! Oh, your worships! Oh, Minister Parris!</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Why put the maid to this needless agony?</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Put the cape over her shoulders.</p>

<p>[Widow Hutchins <i>approaches</i> Ann <i>hesitatingly, and throws
the cape over her shoulders.</i>  Ann <i>sinks upon the floor,
shrieking.</i></p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Take it off! Take it off! It burns! It burns! Take it
off! Have mercy! I shall die! I shall die!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Take off the cape; that is enough. Olive Corey,
what say you to this? This is the cape you gave Ann Hutchins.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Oh, mother! mother!</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> (<i>pushing forward</i>). Nay, I will speak again.
Ye shall not keep me from it; ye shall not send me out of the
meeting-house! (<i>The afflicted cry out.</i>)  Peace, or I will
afflict ye in earnest! I <em>will</em> speak! If I be a witch, as ye
say, then ye have some reason to fear me, even ye most worshipful
magistrates and ministers. It might happen to ye even to fall upon
the floor in torment, and it would ill accord with your offices. Ye
shall hear me. I speak no more for myself&mdash;ye may go hang
me&mdash;I speak for my child. Ye shall not hang her, or judgment
will come upon ye. Ye know there is no guile in her; it were
monstrous to call her a witch. It were less blasphemy to call her an
angel than a witch, and ye know it. Ye know it, all ye maids she hath
played with and done her little kindnesses to, ye who would now go
hang her. That cape&mdash;that cape, most worshipful magistrates, did
the dear child earn with her own little hands, that she might give it
to Ann, whom she loved so much. Knowing, as she did, that Ann was
poor, and able to have but little bravery of apparel, it was often on
her mind to give her somewhat of her own, albeit that was but scanty;
and she hath toiled overtimes at her wheel all winter, and sold the
yarn in Salem, and so gained a penny at a time wherewithal to buy
that cape for Ann. And now will it hang her, the dear child?</p>

<p>Dear Ann, dost thou not remember how thou and my Olive have spent
days together, and slept together many a night, and lain awake till
dawn talking? Dost thou not remember how thou couldst go nowhere
without Olive, nor she without thee, and how no little junketing were
complete to the one were the other not there? Dost thou not remember
how Olive wept when thy father died? Mercy Lewis, dost thou not
remember how my Olive came over and helped thee in thy work that time
thou wert ailing, and how she lent thee her shoes to walk to
Salem?</p>

<p>Oh, dear children, oh, maids, who have been playmates and friends
with my dear child, ye will not do her this harm! Do ye not know that
she hath never harmed ye, and would die first? Think of the time when
this sickness, that is nigh to madness, shall have passed over, and
all is quiet again. Then will ye sit in the meeting-house of a Lord's
day, and look over at the place where my poor child was wont to sit
listening in her little Sabbath best, and ye will see her no more,
but will say to yourselves that ye have murdered her. And then of a
week-day ye will see her no more spinning at her wheel in the
doorway, nor tending the flowers in her garden. She will come smiling
in at your doors no more, nor walk the village street, and ye will
always see where she is not, and know that ye have murdered her. Oh,
poor children, ye are in truth young, and your minds, I doubt not,
sore bewildered! If I have spoken harshly to ye, I pray ye heed it
not, except as concerns me. I wot well that I am now done with this
world, and I feel already the wind that bloweth over Gallows Hill in
my face. But consider well ere ye do any harm to my dear child, else
verily the day will come when ye will be more to be pitied than she.
Oh, ye will not harm her! Ye will take back your accusation! Oh,
worshipful magistrates, oh, Minister Parris, I pray you have mercy
upon this child! I pray you mercy as you will need mercy! [<i>Falls
upon her knees.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Rise, woman; it is not now mercy, but justice
that has to be considered.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  In straits like this there is no mercy in the
divine will. Shall mercy be shown Satan?</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Mercy Lewis, is it in truth Olive Corey who
afflicts you?</p>

<p><i>Mercy</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). I am not so sure as I was.</p>

<p><i>Other Afflicted Girls.</i>  Nor I! nor I! nor I!</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  Last time I was somewhat blinded and could not see
her face. Methinks she was something taller than Olive.</p>

<p><i>Ann</i> (<i>shrieks</i>). Oh, Olive is upon me! The sun shines
on her face! I see her, she is choking me! Oh! oh!</p>

<p><i>Mercy</i> (<i>to</i> Ann). Hush! If she be put away you'll not
get Paul Bayley; I'll tell you that for a certainty, Ann
Hutchins.</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Oh! oh! she is killing me!</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  I see her naught; 'tis a taller person who is
afflicting Ann. (<i>To</i> Ann.)  Leave your outcries or I will
confess to the magistrates. [Ann <i>becomes quiet.</i></p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Ann Hutchins, saw you in truth Olive Corey
afflicting you?</p>

<p><i>Ann</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). It might have been Goody Corey.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Mercy Lewis, saw you of a certainty Olive Corey
walking in the wood with a black man?</p>

<p><i>Mercy.</i>  It was the wane of the moon; I might have been
mistaken. It might have been Goody Corey; their carriage is somewhat
the same.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Give me the cape, Widow Hutchins. (Widow Hutchins
<i>hands him the cape; he puts it over his shoulders.</i>)  Verily I
perceive no great inconvenience from the cape, except it is an ill
fit.</p>

<p>[<i>Takes it off and lays it on the table. The two magistrates
and</i> Minister Parris <i>whisper together.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Having now received the testimony of the
afflicted and the witnesses, and duly weighted the same according to
our judgment, being aided to a decision, as we believe, by the divine
wisdom which we have invoked, we declare the damsel Olive Corey free
and quit of the charges against her. And Martha Corey, the wife of
Giles Corey, of Salem Village, we commit unto the jail in Salem
until&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Send Martha to Salem jail! Out upon ye! Why, ye be
gone clean mad, magistrates and ministers and all! Send Martha to
jail! Why, she must home with me this night and get supper! How think
ye I am going to live and keep my house? Load Martha down with chains
in jail! Martha a witch! Then, by the Lord, she keeps His company
overmuch for one of her trade, for she goes to prayer forty times a
day. Martha a witch! Think ye Goodwife Martha Corey gallops a
broomstick to the hill of a night, with her decent petticoats
flapping? Who says so? I would I had my musket, and he'd not say so
twice to Giles Corey. And let him say so twice as 'tis, and meet my
fist, an he dares. I be an old man, but I could hold my own in my
day, and there be some of me left yet. Who says so twice to old Giles
Corey? Martha a witch! Verily she could not stop praying long enough
to dance a jig through with the devil. Martha! Out upon ye, ye lying
devil's tool of a parson, that seasons murder with prayer! Out upon
ye, ye magistrates! your hands be redder than your fine trappings!
Martha a witch! Ye yourselves be witches, and serving Satan, and he
a-tickling in his sleeve at ye. Send Martha in chains to Salem jail,
ye will, will ye? (<i>Forces his way to</i> Martha, <i>and throws his
arm around her.</i>)  Be not afraid, good lass, thy man will save
thee. Thou shalt not go to jail! I say thou shalt not! I'll cut my
way through a whole king's army ere thou shalt. I'll raise the devil
myself ere thou shalt, and set him tooth and claw on the whole brood
of them. I'll&mdash;(<i>One of the afflicted shrieks.</i>  Giles
<i>turns upon them.</i>)  Why, devil take ye, ye lying hussies, ye
have done this! Ye should be whipped through the town at the tail of
a cart, every one of ye. Ye ill-favored little jades, puling because
no man will have ye, and putting each other up to this d&mdash;
mischief for lack of something better. Out upon ye, ye
little&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mercy</i> (<i>jumping up and screaming in agony</i>). Oh, Giles
Corey is upon me! He is afflicting me grievously! Oh, I will not!
Chain him! chain him! chain him!</p>

<p><i>Ann.</i>  Oh, this is worse than the others! This is dreadful!
He's strangling me! I&mdash;Oh&mdash;your&mdash;worships!
Oh&mdash;help!&mdash;help! [<i>Falls upon the floor.</i></p>

<p><i>The living-room in</i> Giles Corey's <i>house.</i>  Nancy Fox
<i>and the child</i> Ph&oelig;be Morse <i>sit beside the hearth; each
has her apron over her face, weeping.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>sobbing</i>). I&mdash;want my
Aunt&mdash;Corey and&mdash;my Uncle Corey. Why don't they come? Oh,
deary me!</p>

<p>[Ph&oelig;be <i>jumps up and runs to the window.</i></p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  See you anybody coming?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  There is a dame in a black hood coming past
the popple-trees. Oh, Nancy, come quick; see if it be Aunt Corey!</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Where be my spectacles&mdash;where be they?
(<i>Runs about the room searching.</i>)  Oh Lord, what's the use of
living to be so old that you're scattered all over the house like a
seed thistle! Having to hunt everywhere for your eyes and your wits
whenever you want to use 'em, and having other folks a-meddling with
'em! Where be the spectacles? They be not in the cupboard; they be
not on the dresser. Where be they? I trow this be witch-work. I know
well enough what has become of my good horn spectacles. Goody Bishop
hath witched them away, thinking they would suit well with her fine
hood. I know well that I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be</i> (<i>sobbing aloud</i>). Oh, Nancy, it is not
Aunt Corey. It is only Goodwife Nourse.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  May the black beast catch her! Be you sure?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Yes; she is passing our gate. Oh, Nancy, what
shall we do? what shall we do?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I would that I had my fingers in old man Hathorne's
fine wig. I would yank it off for him, and fling it to the pigs.
A-sending master and mistress to jail, and they no more witches than
I be!</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, be we witches? They have not sent
us to jail.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I know not what we be. My old head will not hold it
all. It is time they came home. There is not a crumb of sweet-cake in
the house, and the stopple is so tight in the cider-barrel that I
cannot stir it a peg. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Nancy, did they send Aunt Corey and Uncle
Corey to jail because I stuck the pins in my doll?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I know not. I tell ye my old head spins round like
a flax-wheel; when I put my finger on one spoke 'tis another one.
These things be too much for a poor old woman like me. It takes folks
like their worships the magistrates and Minister Parris to deal with
black men and witches, and keep their wits in no need of physic.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Nancy, I know what I will do! Oh, 'tis
well I snatched my doll off the meeting-house table that day after
the trial, and ran home with it under my apron! (<i>Runs to the
settle, takes up the doll, which is lying there, and kisses it.</i>)
Here is one kiss for Aunt Corey, here is another kiss for Aunt Corey,
here is another, and another, and another. Here is one kiss for Uncle
Corey, and here is another kiss for Uncle Corey, and here is another,
and another, and another. There, Nancy! will not this do away with
the pin pricks, and they be let out of jail?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  I know not. My old head bobs like a pumpkin in a
pond. I would master and mistress were home. These be troublous times
for an old woman. I would I could stir the stopple in the
cider-barrel. Look again, and see if mistress be not coming up the
road.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  It is of no use. I have looked for a whole
week, and she has not come in sight. I want my Aunt Corey! Nancy,
have I not done away with the pin pricks? Tell me, will she be not
let out of jail? Oh, there's Paul coming past the window! He's got
home! Olive! Olive!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Paul Bayley. Ph&oelig;be <i>runs to him.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Paul, they've put Aunt Corey and Uncle
Corey in Salem jail while you were gone! Can't you get them out,
Paul, can't you?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Where is Olive?</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  She is in her chamber. She stays there all
the time at prayer. Olive! Olive! Paul is come.</p>

<p>[<i>Calls at the foot of chamber stairs.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Olive!</p>

<p>Olive <i>comes slowly down the stairs and enters.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>seizing her in his arms</i>). Oh, my poor lass,
what is this that hath come to thee?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  This is what thou feared when we parted, Paul, and
more.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I but heard of it as I came through Salem on my way
hither. Oh, 'tis devilish work!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  They let me loose, but father and mother are in
Salem jail.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Poor lass!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Can you do naught to help them, Paul?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Olive, I will help them, if there be any justice or
unclouded minds left in the colony.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Thou art in truth here, Paul; it is thy voice.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Whose voice should it be, dear heart?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I know not. For a week I have thought I heard so
many voices. The air seemed full of voices a-calling me, but I heeded
them not, Paul. I kept all the time at prayer and heeded them
not.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Of course thou didst not. There were no voices to
heed.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Sometimes I thought I heard birds twittering, and
sometimes I thought there was something black at my elbow, and in the
night-time faces at my window. Paul, was there aught there?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  No, no; there was naught there. Birds and black
beasts and faces! This be all folly, Olive!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  They saw a black man by my side in the
meeting-house&mdash; Ann saw him. She cried out that the cape I gave
her put her to dreadful torment. Can I have been a witch unknowingly,
and so done this great evil to my father and mother? Tell me,
Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Call up thy wits, Olive! I tell thee thou art no
witch. There was no black man at thy side in the meeting-house. Black
man! I would one would verily lay hands on that lying hussy. Thou art
no witch.</p>

<p>[Ph&oelig;be <i>rushes to</i> Olive, <i>and clings to her,
sobbing.</i></p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  You are not a witch, Olive. You are not. If
Ann says so I will pinch her and scratch her. I will! yes, I
will&mdash;I will scratch her till the blood runs. You are not a
witch. I was the one that got them into jail. I stuck pins into my
doll, but I have made up for it now. They'll be let out. Don't cry,
Olive.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Don't you fret yourself, Olive. I trow there's no
witch-mark on you. It's Goody Bishop in her fine silk hood that's at
the bottom on't. I know, I know. Perchance Paul could loose the
stopple in the cider-barrel. I am needful of somewhat to warm my old
bones. This witch-work makes them to creep with chills like long
snakes.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  They say my mother will soon be hanged, and I
perchance a witch, and the cause of it. I cannot get over it.
(<i>Moves away from them.</i>)  If I be a witch, I shall hurt thee,
as I perchance have hurt them. [<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Olive Corey, what is that?</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>looking up</i>). What? What mean you, Paul?
[Nancy <i>and</i> Ph&oelig;be <i>stare.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  There, over the cupboard. Is it&mdash; Yes,
'tis&mdash;cobwebs. I trow I never saw such a sight in Goodwife
Corey's house before.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I will brush them down, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>looking at the floor</i>). And I doubt me much if
the floor has been swept up this week past, and the hearth is all
strewn with ashes. I trow Goodwife Corey would weep could she see her
house thus.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I will get the broom, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I know well thou hast not spun this last week, that
the cream is too far gone to be churned, and the cheeses have not
been turned.</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  'Tis so, Paul; and there's no sweet-cake in the
house, either.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Thou art no such housewife as thy mother, Olive
Corey! One would say she had not taught thee. I trow she was a good
housewife, and notable among the neighbors; but this will take from
her reputation that she hath so brought thee up. I trow could she see
this house 'twould give her a new ache in her heart among all the
others.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I will mind the house, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Ay, mind the house, poor lass! Know you, Olive, that
there is a rumor abroad in Salem that your father will refuse to
plead, and will stand mute at his trial?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Wherefore will he do that?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I scarcely know why. Has he made a will, 'twill not
be valid were he to plead at a criminal trial; there will be an
attainder on it. They say that is one reason, and that he thinks thus
to show his scorn of the whole devilish work, and of a trial that is
no trial.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  What is the penalty if he stand mute?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  'Tis a severe one; but he shall not stand mute.</p>

<p><i>Ph&oelig;be.</i>  Oh, Paul, get Aunt Corey out of jail! Can't
you get Aunt Corey out of jail?</p>

<p><i>Nancy.</i>  Perchance you could pry up the hook of the jail
door with the old knife. It will be dark to-night. There is no moon
until three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Paul, think you not that my father's sons-in-law
might do somewhat? They are men of influence. Their wives are but my
half-sisters, but they are his own daughters. I marvel they have not
come to me since this trouble.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Olive, his sons-in-law have sent in their written
testimony against him and your mother.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Paul, it cannot be so!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  They have surely so testified. There is no help to
be had from them. I have a plan.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  All is useless, Paul. His sons-in-law, his own
daughters' husbands, have turned against him! There is no help
anywhere. My mother will soon be hanged. Minister Parris said so last
night when he came. And he knelt yonder and prayed that I might no
longer practise witchcraft. My father and mother are lost, and I have
brought it upon them. Talk no more to me, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Then, perchance your mother be a witch, Olive
Corey.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My mother is not a witch.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Doth not Minister Parris say so? And if he speak
truth when he calls you a witch, why speaks he not truth of your
mother also? I trow, if you be a witch, she is.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My mother is no witch, and I am no witch, Paul
Bayley!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Mind you stick to that, poor lass! Now, I go to
Boston to the Governor. There lies the only hope for thy parents.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Think you the Governor will listen? Oh, he must
listen! Thou hast a masterful way with thee, Paul. When wilt thou
start? Oh, if I had not thee!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I would I could make myself twenty-fold 'twixt thee
and evil, sweet. I will get Goodman Nourse's horse and start
to-night.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Then go, go! Do not wait!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I will not wait. Good-by, dear heart. Keep good
courage, and put foolish fancies away from thee. [<i>Embraces
her.</i></p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>freeing herself</i>). This is no time for
love-making, Paul. I will mind the house well and keep at prayer.
Thou need'st not fear. Now, haste, haste! Do not wait!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I will be on the Boston path in a half-hour.
Good-by, Olive. Please God, I'll bring thee back good news.
[<i>Exit</i> Paul.</p>

<p>[Olive <i>stands in the door watching him depart.</i>  Ph&oelig;be
<i>steals up to her and throws her arms around her.</i>  Olive
<i>turns suddenly and embraces the child.</i></p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Come, sweet; while Paul sets forth to the Governor,
we will go to prayer. Nancy, come, we will go to prayer that the
Governor may lend a gracious ear, and our feet be kept clear of the
snares of Satan. Come, we will go to prayer; there is naught left for
us but to go to prayer!</p>

<p><i>Six weeks later.</i>  Giles Corey's <i>cell in Salem jail. It
is early morning.</i>  Giles, <i>heavily chained, is sleeping upon
his bed. A noise is heard at the door.</i>  Giles <i>stirs and raises
himself.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Yes, Martha, I'm coming. (<i>Noise continues.</i>)
I'm coming, Martha. (<i>Stares around the cell.</i>)  God help me,
but I thought 'twas Martha calling me to supper, and 'tis a month
since she died on Gallows Hill. I verily thought that I smelt the
pork frying and the pan-cakes.</p>

<p><i>The door is opened and the</i> Guard, <i>bringing a dish of
porridge, enters; he sets it on the floor beside the bed, then
examines</i> Giles's <i>chains.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Make sure they be strong, else it will verily go
hard with the hussies. They will screech louder yet, and be more like
pin-cushions than ever. Art sure they be strong? 'Twere a pity such
guileless and tender maids should suffer, and old Giles Corey's hands
be rough. He hath hewn wood and handled the plough for nigh eighty
years with them, and now these pretty maids say he hurts their soft
flesh. In truth, they must be sore afflicted. Prithee are the chains
well riveted? I thought last night one link seemed somewhat loose as
though it might be forced, and old Giles Corey hath still some
strength; and hath he witchcraft, as they say, it might well make him
stronger. Be wary about the chains for the sake of those godly and
tender maids.</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> Guard. Giles <i>takes the dish of porridge and
eats.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles</i> (<i>making a wry face</i>). This be rare porridge; it
be rare enough to charge the cook on't with witchcraft. It might well
have been scorched in some hell-fire. I trow Martha would have flung
it to the pigs. I verily thought 'twas Martha calling me to supper,
and I smelt the good food cooking, and Martha hung a month since on
Gallows Hill. Who's that at the door now?</p>

<p>Guard <i>opens the door and</i> Paul Bayley <i>enters.</i>  Giles
<i>takes another spoonful of porridge.</i></p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Good-day, Goodman Corey.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Taste this porridge, will ye.</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>tastes the porridge</i>). 'Tis burned.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  It be rare food to keep up the soul of an old man
who hath set himself to undergo what I have set myself to undergo.
But it matters not. I trow old Giles Corey may well have eat all his
life unknowingly to this end, and hath now somewhat of strength to
fall back upon. He needs no dainty fare to make him strong to undergo
what he hath set himself. How fares my daughter?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  As well as she can fare, poor lass! I saw her last
evening. She is now calmer in her mind, and she goeth about the house
like her mother.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Her mother set great store by her. She would often
strive in prayer that she should not make an idol of her before the
Lord.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Goodman, it goes hard to tell you, but I had an
audience yesterday again with Governor Phipps, an' 'twas in vain.</p>

<p><i>Giles</i> (<i>laughing</i>). In vain, say ye 'twas in vain?
Why, I looked to see the pardon sticking out of your waistcoat
pocket! Why went ye again to Boston? Know ye not that this whole land
is now a bedlam, and the Governors and the magistrates swell the
ravings? Seek ye in bedlam for justice of madmen? It is not now
pardon or justice that we have to think on, but death, and the best
that can be made out on't. Know ye that my trial will be held this
afternoon?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Yes, Goodman Corey.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Sit ye down on this stool. I have much I would say
to ye.</p>

<p>[Paul <i>seats himself on a stool.</i>  Giles <i>sits on his
bed.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Master Bayley, ye have been long a-courting my
daughter. Do ye propose in good faith to take her to wife?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  With the best faith that be in me.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Then I tell ye, man, take her speedily&mdash;take
her within three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I would take her with all my heart, goodman, would
she be willing.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  She must needs be willing. Why, devil take it! be
ye not smart enough to make her willing? It will all go for naught if
she be not willing. Tell her her father bids her. She hath ever
minded her father.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I will tell her so, goodman.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Tell her 'tis the last command her father gives
her. If she say no, hear it yes. Do not ye give it up if ye have to
drag her to 't. Why, she must not be left alone in the world. It be a
hard world. Old Giles hath gone far in it, and found it ever a hard
world. Verily it be not cleared any more than the woods of
Massachusetts. It be hard enough for a man; a young maid must needs
have somebody to hold aside the boughs for her. Wed her, if she will
or no. I have somewhat to show ye, Master Bayley. (<i>Draws a
document from his waistcoat.</i>)  See ye this?</p>

<p>[Paul <i>takes the document and examines it.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  See ye what 'tis?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  It is a deed whereby you convey all your property to
me, so I be Olive's husband. Wherefore?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  It be drawn up in good form. It be duly witnessed.
You see that it be all in good form, Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I see. But wherefore?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  It will stand in law; there will be no getting
loose from it. It be a good and trusty document. But&mdash;so be it
that this afternoon I stand trial for witchcraft, and plead guilty or
not guilty, this same good and trusty document will be worth less
than the parchment 'tis writ on. 'Tis so with the law. There will be
an attainder on't. My sons-in-law that testified to the undoing of
Martha and me will have their share, and thou and Olive perchance
have naught in this bedlam. I bear no ill will toward my sons-in-law
and my daughters, who have been put up by them to deal falsely with
Martha and me, but I would not that they have my goods. I bear no ill
will; it becometh not a man so near death to bear ill will. But they
shall not have my goods; I say they shall not. There shall be no
attainder on this document. I will stand mute at my trial.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Goodman Corey, know you the penalty?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I trow I know it better than the catechism. 'Tis to
be pressed beneath stone weights until I be dead.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I say you shall not do this thing. What think you I
care for your goods? I'll have naught to do with them, nor will
Olive. This is madness!</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  'Tis not all for the goods. I would Olive had them,
and not those foul traitors; but 'tis not all. Were there no goods
and no attainder, I would still do this thing. Paul, they say that
Martha spake fair words when they had her there on Gallows Hill.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  She spake like a martyr at the door of heaven.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Did they let her speak long?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  They cut her short, Minister Parris saying,
&ldquo;Let not this firebrand of hell burn longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Then they put the rope to her neck. Martha had a
fair neck when she was a maid. Did she struggle much?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Not much.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Then they left her hanging there a space. It was a
wet day, and the rain pelted on her. I remember it was a wet day. The
rain pelted on her, and the wind blew, and she swung in it. I swear
to thee, lass, I will make amends! I will suffer twenty pangs for thy
one.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  'Tis not you who should make amends.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I tell ye I did Martha harm. When she chid my folly
and the folly of others, I did bawl out at her, and say among folk
things to her undoing, though I meant it not as they took it. Now I
will make amends, and the King himself shall not stop me. Martha was
a good wife. I know not how I shall make myself seemly for the court
this afternoon. My coat has many stitches loose in it. She was a good
wife. I will make amends to thee, lass; I swear I shall make amends
to thee! I will come where thou art by a harder road than the one I
made thee go.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  It was not you, goodman. You overblame yourself.
Those foul-mouthed jades did it, and those bloodthirsty
magistrates.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I tell ye I did part on't. I was wroth with her
that she made light of this witch-work over which I was so mightily
wrought up, and I said words that they twisted to her undoing.
Verily, words can be made to fit all fancies. 'Twere safer to be
mute&mdash;as I'll be this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Goodman Corey, you must not think of this thing.
There is still some hope from the trial. They will not dare murder
you too.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  There be some things in this world folks may not
bear, but there be no wickedness they'll stick at when they get
started on the way to 't. 'Tis death in any case, and what would ye
have me do? Stand before their mad worships and those screeching
jades, and plead as though I were before folk of sound mind and
understanding? Think ye I would so humble myself for naught?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  But Olive! I tell you 'twill kill her! There may be
a chance yet, and you should throw not away however small a one for
Olive's sake. She can bear no more.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  There is no chance, and if there were&mdash;I tell
ye if I had a hundred daughters, and every one such a maid as she,
and every one were to break her heart, I would do this thing I have
set myself to do. There be that which is beyond human ties to force a
man, there be that which is at the root of things.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  We will have none of your goods, I tell you that,
Giles Corey!</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Goods. The goods be the least of it! Old Giles
Corey be not a deep man. I trow he hath had a somewhat hard skull,
but when a man draws in sight of death he hath a better grasp at his
wits than he hath dreamed of. This be verily a mightier work than ye
think. It shall be not only old Giles Corey that lies pressed to
death under the stones, but the backbone of this great evil in the
land shall be broke by the same weight. I tell ye it will be so. I
have clearer understanding, now I be so near the end on't. They will
dare no more after me. To-day shall I stand mute at my trial, but my
dumbness shall drown out the clamor of my accusers. Old Giles Corey
will have the best on't. 'Tis for this, and not for the goods, I will
stand mute; for this, and to make amends to Martha.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Giles Corey, you shall not die this dreadful death.
If death it must be, and it may yet not be, choose the easier
one.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Think ye I cannot do it? (<i>Rises.</i>)  Master
Paul Bayley, you see before you Giles Corey. He be verily an old man,
he be over eighty years old, but there be somewhat of the first of
him left. He hath never had much power of speech; his words have been
rough, and not given to pleasing. He hath been a rude man, an
unlettered man, and a sinner. He hath brawled and blasphemed with the
worst of them in his day. He hath given blow for blow, and I trow the
other man's cheek smarted sorer than old Giles's. Now he be a man of
the covenant, but he be still stiff with his old ways, and hath no
nimbleness to shunt a blow. Old Giles Corey hath no fine wisdom to
save his life, and no grace of tongue, but he hath power to die as he
will, and no man hath greater.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Goodman Corey, I&mdash; [Guard <i>opens the
door.</i></p>

<p><i>Guard.</i>  Here is your daughter to see you, Goodman
Corey.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Tell her I will see her not. What brought her here?
I know. Minister Parris hath sent her, thinking to tempt me from my
plan. I will see her not.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>from without</i>). Father, you cannot send me
away.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Why come you here? Go home and mind the house.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father, I pray you not to send me away.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  If you be hard with her, you will kill her.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Come in.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Olive.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  What is this you will do, father?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  My duty, lass.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father, you will not die this dreadful death?</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  That will I, lass.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Then I say to you, father, so will I also. The
stones will press you down a few hours' space, and they will press me
down so long as I may live. You will be soon dead and out of the
pains, but you will leave your death with the living.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Then must the living bear it.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father, you may yet be acquitted. Plead at your
trial.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Work the bellows in the face of the north wind. Oh,
lass, why came you here? 'Tis worse than the stones. Talk no more to
me, good lass; womenkind should meddle not with men's plans. But
promise me you will wed with Paul here within three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I will never wed.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Ye will not, hey? Ye will wed with Master Paul
Bayley within three weeks. 'Tis the last command your father gives
thee.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Think you I can wed when you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Ay, I do think so, lass, and so ye will.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father, I will not. But if you plead I will, I
promise you I will.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  I will not, and you will. Lass, since you be here,
I pray you set a stitch in this seam in my coat. I would look tidy at
the trial, for thy mother's sake. Hast thou thy huswife with
thee?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Yes, father.</p>

<p>[Olive <i>threads a needle, and standing beside her father, sets
the stitch; weeps as she does so.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Know you every tear adds weight to the stones,
lass?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Then will I weep not. [<i>Mends.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Be the child and the old woman well?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Yes, father.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Look out for them as you best can. And see to 't
the little maid's linen chest is well filled, as your mother would
have.</p>

<p>[Olive <i>breaks off the thread.</i></p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Be the stitch set strong?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Yes, father.</p>

<p><i>Giles</i> (<i>turning and folding her to his arms</i>). Oh, my
good lass, the stones be naught, but this cometh hard, this cometh
hard! Could they not have spared me this?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father, listen to me, listen to me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Lass, I must listen to naught but the voice of God.
'Tis that speaks, and bids me do this thing. Thou must come not
betwixt thy father and his God.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Father! father!</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Go, Olive, I can bear no more. Tell me thou wilt
wed as I command you.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  As thou wilt, father! father! but I will love no
man as I love thee.</p>

<p><i>Giles.</i>  Go, lass. Give me a kiss. There, now go! I command
thee to go! Paul, take her hence. I charge ye do by her when her
father be dead and gone, as ye would were he at thy elbow. Take her
hence. I would go to prayer.</p>

<p>[<i>Exeunt</i> Paul <i>and</i> Olive.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>as the door closes</i>). Father! father!</p>

<p>Giles Corey <i>stands alone in cell. Curtain falls.</i></p>

<h3 align="center">Act VI.</h3>

<p><i>Three weeks later. Lane near Salem overhung by blossoming
apple-trees. Enter</i> Hathorne, Corwin, <i>and</i> Parris.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  'Tis better here, a little removed from the field
where they are putting Giles Corey to death. I could bear the sight
of it no longer.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  You are fainthearted, good Master Corwin.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Fainthearted or not, 'tis too much for me. I was
brought not up in the shambles, nor bred butcher by trade.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Your worship, you should strive in prayer, lest
you falter not in the strife against Satan.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  I know not that I have faltered in any strife
against Satan.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Perchance 'tis but your worship's delicate frame
of body causeth you to shrink from this stern duty.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  This torment of Giles Corey's can last but a
little space now. He hath still his chance to speak and avert his
death, and he will do it erelong. They have increased the weights
mightily. Fear not, good Master Corwin, Giles Corey will not die;
erelong his old tongue will wag like a millwheel.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  I doubt much, good Master Hathorne, if Giles Corey
speak. And if he does not speak, and so be put to death, as is
decreed, I doubt much if the temper of the people will stand more.
There are those who have sympathy with Giles Corey. I heard many
murmurs in the streets of Salem this morning.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Let them murmur.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Ay, let them murmur, so long as we wield the sword
of the Lord and of Gideon.</p>

<p><i>Enter first</i> Messenger.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Here comes a man from the field. How goes it now
with Giles Corey?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i>  Your worship, Giles Corey has not spoken.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  And he hath been under the weights since early
light. Truly such obstinacy is marvellous. [<i>Exit</i>
Messenger.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Satan gives a strength beyond human measure to
his disciples.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Olive <i>and</i> Paul Bayley, <i>appearing in the
distance.</i>  Olive <i>wears a white gown and white bonnet.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Who is that maid coming in a bride bonnet?</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  'Tis Corey's daughter. I marvel that Paul lets her
come hither. 'Tis no place for her, so near. Master Hathorne, let us
withdraw a little way. I would not see her distress. I am somewhat
shaken in nerve this morning.</p>

<p>[Corwin, Hathorne, <i>and</i> Parris <i>exeunt at other end of
lane.</i></p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>as she and</i> Paul <i>advance</i>). Who were
those men, Paul?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  The magistrates and Minister Parris, sweet.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Are they gone?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Yes, they are quite out of sight. Oh, why wouldst
thou come here, dear heart?</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Thou thinkest to cheat me, Paul; but thou canst not
cheat me. Three fields away to the right have they dragged my father
this morning. I knew it, I knew it, although you strove so hard to
keep it from me. I'll be as near my father's death-bed on my
wedding-day as I can.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  I pray thee, sweetheart, come away with me. This
will do no good.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Loyalty doth good to the heart that holds it, if to
no other. Think you I'll forsake my father because 'tis my
wedding-day, Paul? Oh, I trow not, I trow not, or I'd make thee no
true wife.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  It but puts thee to needless torment.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Torment! torment! Think of what he this moment
bears! Oh, my father, my father! Paul Bayley, why have I wedded you
this dreadful day!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Hush! Thy father wished it, sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I swear to you I'll never love any other than my
father. I love you not.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Thou needst not, poor lass!</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>clinging to him</i>). Nay, I love thee, but I
hate myself for it on this day.</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> (<i>caressing her</i>). Poor lass! Poor lass!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Why wear I this bridal gear, and my father over
yonder on his dreadful death-bed? Why could you not have gone your
own way and let me gone mine all the rest of my life in black
apparel, a-mourning for my father? That would have beseemed me. This
needed not have been so; it needed never have been so.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Never? I tell thee, sweet, as well say to these
apple blossoms that they need never be apples, and to that rose-bush
against the wall that its buds need not be roses. In faith, we be far
set in that course of nature, dear, with the apple blossoms and the
rose-buds, where the beginning cannot be without the end. Our own
motion be lost, and we be swept along with a current that is mightier
than death, whether we would have it so or not.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I know not. I only know I would be faithful to my
poor father. But 'twas his last wish that I should wed thee thus.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Yes, dear.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  He said so that morning before his trial. Oh, Paul,
I can see it now, the trial! I have been to the trial every day
since. Shall I go every day of my life? Perchance thou may often come
home and find thy wife gone to the trial, and no supper. I will go on
my wedding-day; my father shall have no slights put upon him. I can
see him stand there, mute. They cry out upon him and mock him and lay
false charges upon him, and he stands mute. The judge declares the
dreadful penalty, and he stands mute. Oh, my father, my poor father!
I tell ye my father will not mind anything. The Governor and the
justices may command him as they will, the afflicted may clamor and
gibe as they will, and I may pray to him, but he will not mind, he
will stand mute. I tell ye there be not power enough in the colony to
make him speak. Ye know not my father. He will have the best of
it.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Thou speakest like his daughter now. Keep thyself up
to this, sweet. The daughter of a hero should have some brave stuff
in her. Thy father does a greater deed than thou knowest. His
dumbness will save the colonies from more than thou dreamest of.
'Twill put an end to this dreadful madness; he himself hath foretold
it. [<i>A clamor is heard.</i></p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  Paul, Paul, what is that?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Naught but some boys shouting, sweet.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  'Twas not. Oh, my father, my father!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i>  Olive, thou must not stay here.</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  I must stay. Who is coming? [Paul <i>and</i> Olive
<i>step aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter second</i> Messenger. Hathorne, Corwin, <i>and</i> Parris
<i>advance to meet him.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  How goes it now with Giles Corey?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i>  Your worship, Giles Corey hath not spoken.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  What! Have they not increased the weights?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i>  They have doubled the weights, your
worship.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  I trow Satan himself hath put his shoulder under
the stones to take off the strain. [<i>Exit</i> Messenger.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  'Tis a marvel the old tavern-brawler endures so
long, but he'll soon speak now.</p>

<p><i>Corwin.</i>  Hush, good master, his daughter can hear.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Let her then withdraw if it please her not. I'll
warrant he cannot bear much more; he will soon speak.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Yea, he cannot withstand the double weight unless
his master help him.</p>

<p>[Corwin <i>speaks aside to</i> Paul <i>and motions him to take</i>
Olive <i>away.</i>  Paul <i>takes her by the arm. She shakes her head
and will not go.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  I trow 'twill take other than an unlettered
clown like Giles Corey to stand firm under this stress. He'll speak
soon.</p>

<p><i>Parris.</i>  Yea, that he will. He can never hold out. He hath
not the mind for it.</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  It takes a man of finer wit than he to undergo
it. He will speak. Oh yes, fear ye not, he will speak.</p>

<p><i>Olive</i> (<i>breaking away from</i> Paul). My father will
<em>not</em> speak!</p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  Girl!</p>

<p><i>Olive.</i>  My father will <em>not</em> speak. I tell ye there
be not stones enough in the provinces to make him speak. Ye know not
my father. My father will have the best of ye all.</p>

<p><i>Enter third</i> Messenger, <i>running.</i></p>

<p><i>Hathorne.</i>  How goes it now with Giles Corey?</p>

<p><i>Messenger.</i>  Giles Corey is dead, and he has not spoken.</p>

<p>Olive <i>clings to</i> Paul <i>as curtain falls.</i></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
